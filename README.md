- 😼 Cat servant first, anime addict second, human third.  
- 🎨 Digital art & design junkie – because pixels need love too.

- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Express, Flask, Django, Next.js, Spaghetti Code  
- **Tools:** Figma, VS Code (with 500 extensions), Neovim (trying, failing), IbisPaint  
- **OS:** Windows (modded to oblivion), Linux (because I like pain), macOS (just kidding! I don’t hab one)  

## 🎌 Anime & Weeb Stuff  
- 📺 Binge-watching anime is a skill, and I’ve mastered it.  
- 🍜 Ramen and anime marathons = perfect weekend.  
- 🔥 "No anime, no life" – a philosophy I live by.
